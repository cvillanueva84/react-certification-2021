# Using create-react-app, what do we need to set up for testing?
Jest and React Testing Library are already included. We need to create a test files and import testing-library/react on each one.

# What components are worth to test in your development?
In every component, if we validate that we'll be sure that this component does not cause an error when doing the build.

It's possible. But in the correct methodology of TDD you shouldn't.
